## Architecture overview

Pure algorithm functions emit trace events, a tracer records the log, a stepper produces visualization states, and UI renders with SVG.

### Adding a New Algorithm

To add a new pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*):

1.  **Create the Algorithm File:** Create a new file in `lib/algorithms/core/yourAlgo.ts` with the PathfindingAlgorithm signature and call trace for progress events.
2.  **Implement the Algorithm:** Implement your algorithm as a pure function with the `PathfindingAlgorithm` signature from `lib/algorithms/types.ts`.
      
3.  **Register the Algorithm:** In `components/GraphSimulator.tsx`, (`ALGORITHMS` and `ALGORITHM_NAMES`).

- The UI will surface it in the dropdown automatically.

Example:
 ```typescript
       import { PathfindingAlgorithm } from '../types';

       export const astar: PathfindingAlgorithm = (graph, startId, endId, trace) => {
         // trace({ type: 'visit', nodeId: 'A', distance: 10 });
        //return { path: [], distances: {} };
       };
   ```
## üì¶ Data format (schema v1) 

- [ ] metadata: { directed: boolean; weighted: boolean; name?: string; description?: string }

- [ ] nodes: Array<{ id: string; x: number; y: number; label?: string }> with normalized coordinates in.

- [ ] edges: Array<{ from: string; to: string; weight: number; label?: string }> with non‚Äënegative weights for Dijkstra.

Example:
```typescript
       {
  "metadata": { "directed": false, "weighted": true, "name": "Sample" },
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "A", "x": 0.1, "y": 0.2, "label": "Start" },
    { "id": "B", "x": 0.7, "y": 0.4 },
    { "id": "C", "x": 0.4, "y": 0.8, "label": "End" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "from": "A", "to": "B", "weight": 2 },
    { "from": "A", "to": "C", "weight": 5 },
    { "from": "C", "to": "B", "weight": 1 }
  ]
}
   ```
## Requirements ‚Äî Simulator (MVP)

### Goal and scope
- Visual simulator for shortest‚Äëpath algorithms with Dijkstra implemented; users select start/end and watch stepwise animation.

### Core features
- Load graph JSON, validate schema and weights, and render via SVG with nodes, edges, and weight labels.


- Controls: Play/Pause, Step, Reset, Speed; states: frontier, current, visited/finalized, relaxed, final path.

Queue/frontier panel and distance labels near nodes for clarity.

### Constraints
- Non‚Äënegative edge weights; treat graph as undirected when metadata.directed is false.

### UI/UX guidelines
- Minimal pastel theme with shadcn components; toasts for feedback via Sonner.


- Tooltips for key actions; keyboard shortcuts (Space, N, R) are optional.

### Performance targets
- Smooth interaction for graphs up to ~200 nodes and ~400 edges with SVG.

### Testing (minimum)
- Unit tests for Dijkstra distances/predecessors and schema validators on small graphs.

### Acceptance criteria
- Sample graph renders; user picks start/end; Play animates Dijkstra, Step advances once, Reset returns to initial; final path is emphasized.

## üß≠ Simulator checklist

- [ ]  JSON load validates schema and edge weights before render.




- [ ] Controls: Play/Pause, Step, Reset, Speed; states: frontier/current/visited/relaxed/final path.


- [ ] Start/end selectable; final shortest path clearly highlighted.


- [ ] Reject negative weights with clear message.


- [ ] Optional: queue/frontier panel and distance labels per node.


- [ ] Sonner toasts for load/validate/run/reset feedback.


- [ ] Optional shortcuts: Space, N, R (documented if omitted).


- [ ] Handles ~200 nodes / ~400 edges smoothly.


- [ ] Tests cover Dijkstra and schema validators.


- [ ] Acceptance flow matches criteria above



## Requirements ‚Äî Graph Builder üß±
### Goal and scope
- Interactive page at /builder to create and edit graphs conforming to the schema, with a clean shadcn + Tailwind UI and minimal dependencies.

### In scope (MVP)
- Forms to add nodes (id, x, y, label) and edges (from, to, weight, label), edit metadata (directed, weighted, name, description), drag nodes on canvas, and export/import JSON.

- Subtle SVG grid with normalized ticks; coordinates are normalized to and persist on drag.

### Validation and rules
- Unique, non‚Äëempty node ids; edges reference existing nodes; finite non‚Äënegative weights for Dijkstra; if unweighted, use weight = 1 on export.

### Canvas and rendering
- SVG with circles for nodes (id inside, label outside), lines with optional arrows for directed graphs, midpoint weight labels, clipped at node boundary to preserve arrowheads.
### UX and accessibility
- Inline validation messages; non‚Äëblocking toasts for success/fail; focus states and aria labels.

### Constants (no magic numbers)
- Define sizes, strokes, grid steps and colors in a constants module used by canvas and builder.

### Import/export
- Export a validated *.json matching the schema; suggested filename: name‚Äëv1.json; import validates and loads or reports errors without mutating state.

### Cross‚Äëpage graph sync
- LocalStorage cache with version and timestamp; Simulator ‚Üî Builder auto‚Äëloads and persists if valid; Clear Graph resets to sample.

### Acceptance criteria
- Create 3+ nodes and 3+ edges; dragging updates geometry; directed toggle shows/hides arrows; grid scales with viewBox; invalid inputs are blocked with clear messages.

### üß± Builder checklist
- [ ] /builder route with shadcn + Tailwind UI.


- [ ] Forms for nodes/edges/metadata; drag to reposition nodes with normalized x,y.


- [ ] Validation: unique node ids; existing references; finite non‚Äënegative weights; unweighted exports use weight '1'.

- [ ] SVG grid and rendering with arrows for directed graphs; midpoint weight labels; no clipped arrowheads.


- [ ] Inline validation + Sonner toasts; focus states and aria labels.


- [ ] Constants module for sizes/strokes/grid/colors.


- [ ] Import/export validated .json; name‚Äëv1.json suggestion; safe import on error.


- [ ] LocalStorage cache with version/timestamp, cross‚Äëpage auto‚Äëload/persist, Clear Graph reset.


- [ ] Acceptance flow matches criteria above.

### Notes and non‚Äëgoals
- Algorithms requiring negative weights (e.g., Bellman‚ÄìFord) are out of scope for MVP; consider later additions like BFS, A*, and Floyd‚ÄìWarshall.


- Advanced layout, panning/zoom, undo/redo, bulk editing, and large‚Äëscale rendering are deferred enhancements.

### Toasts and shadcn
- Use Sonner for non‚Äëblocking toasts with shadcn; see component docs for setup and usage in Next.js.

### Acknowledgements
- Dijkstra fundamentals and educational visualization patterns are widely documented and adapted for UI simulators.

- UI toasts with Sonner; component scaffolding with shadcn UI.
