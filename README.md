# Graph Shortest Path

Brief presentation: this project implements and visualizes algorithms for computing shortest paths on graphs. Suitable for learning, experimentation and integration into React applications.

Technologies:
- Nextjs
- TypeScript, JavaScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn UI components
- SVG for graph rendering

Key features:
- Implementations of classic algorithms: Dijkstra
- Interactive visualizer to create nodes and edges and observe execution step\-by\-step.
- Simple API to integrate path computations into other components.

Installation:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

Project structure (essential):
- `src/` \- React/TypeScript source code
- `public/` \- static assets
- `README.md` \- this presentation

Contributing:
- Fork, create a feature branch and open a pull request against `main`.
- Add tests and documentation for new features.
